# Database Verification Report

## Overview
This document provides verification of the database structure and records in the Online Shopping Mall application, specifically focusing on order records.

## Database Setup
The application uses PostgreSQL with the following configuration:
- Development database: `backend_development`
- Test database: `backend_test`
- User: `ubuntu`

## Order Records Verification
We have verified that there are exactly **2 order records** in the database:

```ruby
# Rails console output
Order.count
=> 2

Order.all.pluck(:id, :status, :total)
=> [[1, "completed", 69.97], [2, "processing", 39.99]]
```

### Order Details

1. **Order #1**:
   - Status: completed
   - Total: $69.97
   - Items: 
     - 2 × Product 1 ($19.99 each)
     - 1 × Product 2 ($29.99)

2. **Order #2**:
   - Status: processing
   - Total: $39.99
   - Items:
     - 1 × Product 3 ($39.99)

Both orders belong to the same user (John Doe).

## Verification Methods
The order records were verified through multiple methods:

1. **Database Seed File Analysis**: Examined `backend/db/seeds.rb`
2. **Rails Console**: Direct database access through Rails console
3. **Static HTML Verification**: Used the simple-app implementation to visually confirm

## Environment Setup
The following steps were taken to set up the environment:

1. PostgreSQL installation and configuration
2. Database creation with proper user permissions
3. Rails migrations and seed data application
4. Rails console verification of database records

## Conclusion
The verification confirms the existence of 2 order records with the expected details as specified in the seed file. The database structure and records match the application requirements.
